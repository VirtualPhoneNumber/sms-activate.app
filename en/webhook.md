# Webhook Integration for SMS Activate

## Overview
Integrating with SMS Activate's webhook service allows you to automate the process of receiving SMS messages directly into your application or system. This feature is particularly useful for developers and businesses that require real-time data entry and further processing of the content received via SMS.

## How It Works
Our webhook integration provides a seamless connection between your systems and our services. When an SMS is received on one of your virtual phone numbers, we instantly push this information to a URL specified by you. This ensures immediate access to the content without any manual intervention.

2. Navigate to the **Dashboard**.
3. Select **Webhook Settings** from the menu.
4. Enter the URL where you wish to receive the incoming SMS data.
5. Save your settings, and you're all set!

### Key Features:
