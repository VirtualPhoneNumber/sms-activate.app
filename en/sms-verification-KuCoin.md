SMS verification emerges as a critical layer of security, providing a quick and reliable method to authenticate user actions.

## Why Use SMS Verification for KuCoin?

- **Secure Transactions:** Each transaction can be verified through a unique code sent via SMS, reducing the risk of fraudulent activities.

To set up SMS verification on KuCoin, follow these steps:

1. **Log into Your KuCoin Account:** Access your account settings and select 'Security.'
2. **Choose to Enable SMS Verification:** You will be prompted to enter your phone number.
